Walk with me in the desert See my hands pierced through All is lost and is suffered And what remains is true We will dance in the cool desert air As darkness falls upon us here Walk with me in the desert (We'll talk along the way) ---------------------------------------------- Come with me to the mountain Take a breath and look down See the road lies before us Leading to promised ground And we will dance in the clear mountain sky Let our spirits learn to fly Come with me to the mountain And see the journey's end ----------------------------------------------- Work with me in the vineyard See the fruit rich and full Bursting forth in its yearning To be carried home And we will dance to a new song Joy will fill our hearts For soon we will be home At the table of our Love ------------------------------------------------- \[Instrumental verse\] We will dance in the cool desert air As darkness falls upon us here Walk with me in the desert (We'll talk along the way) Dedicated to the March, 2001 mission at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church- Oklahoma City, OK conducted by Rev. Michael J. Boulette , entitled "The Journey Within ... The Experience of Lent." Copyright (c) 2001, Robert G. Metivier credits from The Lord Takes Broken Pieces, released October 4, 2001
