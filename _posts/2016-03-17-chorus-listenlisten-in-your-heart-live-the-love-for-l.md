(Chorus) Listen,listen In your heart Live the love For love you have been called Listen, my children In your heart Remember that I still love you so. Long have you struggled I see your losses and your gains As life proves so often To be such an uneven game But in love's shadow Is the message still to be found For the lost and the fallen Soon find holy ground (Chorus) The race is to the quick The well-kept and the learned Not to the broken, surrendered and burned Yet burning is cleansing And the broken are healed. And when you surrender You find love revealed (Chorus) Bring me your passion Your life as your gift Not just praises on high But love well lived For I am one with you My peace will not fade Enter the quiet Of love with me this day (Chorus) ... Remember that I still love you so... Copyright (c) 2000, Robert G. Metivier
