# Embraced By the Spirit
![](http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a2345009720_16.jpg)

Bob Metivier 

You gather the rain In far reaches of the heavens You take wild rivers to tame As they wander through the mountains All the world and its seed Taste the waters You created And in Your Spirit they breathe They bring forth Your celebration ... Lord, send out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth Lord, send out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth On the wings of the wind In the glancing tongues of fire Each fearful heart You enflame With your burning, unceasing desire ... Lord, send out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth Lord, send out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth Send down, Send down Your Spirit on us Send down, Send down Your Spirit on us You call each one by their name Your sons and Your daughters We hear Your call to proclaim Your mercy... and Your power ... Lord, send out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth.  Lord, send out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth Rain down, rain down, rain down on us Rain down, rain down Your Spirit on us ... and renew the face of the earth
