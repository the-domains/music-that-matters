            <description><![CDATA[<p>The old wooden fence  Beaten and torn through the years  By the wind and the sudden storms  -all that nature could conspire to bring.  Yet it somehow managed to hold firm  In its simple purpose  To keep the strangers out and the restless in.    Blistered by the scorching sun  And frozen with the winter sleet  Merciless in their approach  To them a barrier to break  In their unstoppable freedom  But the struggle has its toll  And its frame once strong has since grown old   The workmen said its time to take it down  And build a new one in its place  Its tired planks now broken and spent  Unfastened to the point of disgrace  The nails have left gaping the place  Where long they had held firm  The wounds now far beyond repair.   So the members carelessly taken down  And thrown upon a glowing heap  What once were sap-filled limbs  Its young wood firm and green  Now lies kindling dry for the burn  And to the earth from which it sprung  It now solemnly returns.   Old wooden fence it is no more  Nor any sort of wood at all  Simple offspring of the earth  Ashen dust its final call....  But also fire,- and heat and light  It takes its long-awaited flight  Set free from the nails, and the wind and the storm.   (reprise anthem)  And it is restored though vanquished in flame  Now born anew, an ennobled slave  Released to climb unbound through the clouds  A soul set free from the past and the stony ground   And it is reborn a child of the sky  No more to sustain the wound or the pain  Coursing the air, never meant to return  For now it has attained the end forever yearned.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Walk with me in the desert  See my hands pierced through  All is lost and is suffered  And what remains is true   We will dance in the cool desert air  As darkness falls upon us here  Walk with me in the desert  (We'll talk along the way)   ----------------------------------------------   Come with me to the mountain  Take a breath and look down  See the road lies before us  Leading to promised ground   And we will dance in the clear mountain sky  Let our spirits learn to fly  Come with me to the mountain  And see the journey's end   -----------------------------------------------   Work with me in the vineyard  See the fruit rich and full  Bursting forth in its yearning   To be carried home  And we will dance to a new song  Joy will fill our hearts  For soon we will be home  At the table of our Love   -------------------------------------------------   [Instrumental verse]   We will dance in the cool desert air As darkness falls upon us here Walk with me in the desert (We'll talk along the way)   Dedicated to the March, 2001 mission at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church- Oklahoma City, OK conducted by Rev. Michael J. Boulette , entitled "The Journey Within ... The Experience of Lent."   Copyright © 2001, Robert G.
